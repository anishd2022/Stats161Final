# Final Project

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the Stats C161 final project on Generative AI.

## Project Structure

### Code/
This folder contains analysis files for generating synthetic data and evaluating it. It includes Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, synthetic data generation techniques (SMOTE, ADASYN), and various evaluation metrics.

### Data/
The Data folder contains codebooks that have variable descriptions for the data. These codebooks provide detailed information about the variables in the datasets. The actual raw data files were too large to upload to GitHub.

**To download the raw data**, please visit the following Kaggle dataset:

There is another README file inside the Final/ folder which explains how to set up and run the RAG Chatbot locally.
