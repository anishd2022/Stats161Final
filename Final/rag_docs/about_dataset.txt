About Dataset
Ad recommendation models are usually built based on historical ad impressions, clicks, and other user behavior data. If only data from the ads domain is used, user behavior data will be sparse, and the user behavior types that can be identified will be limited. However, if a user's behavior data in other domains from the same app is explored, the user's interests and behavior characteristics can be better identified. Of course, introducing user behavior data from other apps can also help enrich the data of user behavior characteristics and ad performance.You are expected to enhance ads click-through rate (CTR) prediction accuracy by leveraging ad logs, user profiles, and cross-domain data. With ads as the target domain and news feeds as the source domain, you should build user interest models through impressions, clicks, and other user behavior data obtained from the news feeds domain, thus improving the CTR prediction performance of the ads domain.

Data Description
The provided data includes data from the target domain (such as user behavior logs, user profiles, and ad material information) and that from the source domain (such as user behavior data and basic information about news items).
